Collection of traits and other utilities to help you build your Event-sourced applications in Rust.

## Usage

Add `eventually` into your project dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
eventually = "0.3"
```

Check out [`eventually-test`](eventually-test) crate to see how to use the different
components offered by the crate.

## Project Layout

Eventually is a workspace containing different sub-crates, as follows:

* [`eventually`](eventually): crate containing the public API -- users should only depend on this crate,
* [`eventually-core`](eventually-core): contains foundation traits and types to use Event Sourcing,
* [`eventually-util`](eventually-util): contains set of extensions built on top
of the foundation traits contained in the core crate,
* [`eventually-postgres`](eventually-postgres): contains a PostgreSQL-backed Event Store implementation, to permanently store Domain Events,
* [`eventually-test`](eventually-test): contains an _HTTP service_ example application build using `eventually` and [`tide`](https://github.com/http-rs/tide).


## Versioning

This library is **actively being developed**, and prior to `v1` release the following [Semantic versioning]()
is being adopted:

* Breaking changes are tagged with a new `MINOR` release
* New features, patches and documentation are tagged with a new `PATCH` release
